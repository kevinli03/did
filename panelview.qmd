visualisations for DiD and panel analysis

**panelView** visualises treatment adoption and outcome variables for panel data. It is useful for understanding our data before beginning difference-in-differences analysis.

::: {.panel-tabset group="lang"}
## R

We will need the `panelView` package. Documentation can be found [here](https://yiqingxu.org/packages/panelview/).

If you have not previously installed the package, you can do so as follows:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

install.packages('panelView')
```

Always remember to load the package before starting:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(panelView)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(fixest)
data(base_stagg, package = "fixest")
df <- base_stagg
colnames(df) <- c("id", "time", "cohort", "rel.time", "group", "te", "covar", "outcome")
df$treat <- ifelse(df$rel.time >= 0, 1, 0)
```

#### visualise treatment adoption

panelView can help us visualise treatment adoption over time, allowing us to see if treatment adoption is staggered, and if treatment is absorbing.

::: {.panel-tabset group="lang"}
## R

We use the `panelview()` function to create the visualisation.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| comment: "#>"
#| class-output: r
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center

panelview(
  # required options
  data        = df,
  formula     = outcome ~ treat,  # only include these two
  type        = "treat",          # don't change
  index       = c("id", "time"),
  
  # optional options
  gridOff     = T,
  background  = "white",
  main        = "Treatment Status",
  xlab        = "Time Period",
  ylab        = "Unit",
  cex.axis.y  = 2
)

```

We can see here, that our treatment is staggered, with the first group receiving treatment in time period 2, and some units receiving treatment in every subsequent period.

## Variables

Our dataset `df` should be a panel or repeated cross-section, and have the following variables:

| Variable  | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`      | A variable indicating the units/individual an observation belongs to in our data.\*                  |
| `time`    | A variable indicating time-periods in our study for each observation.                                |
| `outcome` | Outcome variable for each observation.                                                               |
| `treat`   | Treatment variable for each observation. Should equal 1 for treated units and 0 for untreated units. |

panelView can also help us visualise variable values over time. Most frequently, we will visualise outcome values over time, but you can also test covariate values over time.

## R

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| comment: "#>"
#| class-output: r
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center

panelview(
  # required options
  data          = df,
  formula       = outcome ~ treat,  # change to outcome ~ 1 to ignore treat colorcoding
  type          = "outcome",        # don't change
  index         = c("id", "time"),
  pre.post      = F,                # you can try T and see which you like  
  outcome.type  = "continuous",     # change to "discrete" if outcome is binary
  
  # optional options
  gridOff       = T,
  background    = "white",
  main          = "Treatment Status",
  xlab          = "Time Period",
  ylab          = "Outcome Values",
  cex.axis.y    = 2
)

```

| Variable  | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`      | A variable indicating the units/individual an observation belongs to in our data.\*                  |
| `time`    | A variable indicating time-periods in our study for each observation.                                |
| `outcome` | Outcome variable for each observation.                                                               |
| `treat`   | Treatment variable for each observation. Should equal 1 for treated units and 0 for untreated units. |
