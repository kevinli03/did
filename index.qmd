### Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This repository is a collection of resources on the causal identification strategy of Difference-in-Differences (DiD). This repository includes:

1.  A basic overview of DiD, including how it works, and the assumptions. A look at the TWFE estimator in classic DiD.
2.  A series of modern estimators that address issues with TWFE, including a brief description/vignette and R-code.
3.  A series of additional tests/visualisations useful for DiD.

This is a work in progress, and I am updating it constantly. If there are any issues, please contact me - details found on my [personal github page](https://kevinli03.github.io).

This repository was created to help me collect all that I had learned about DiD together into one place. I hope this can be helpful for others.

I would like to thank the following individuals for teaching me so much about DiD and causal inference during my Master's degree at LSE:

-   Dr. Daniel de Kadt
-   Dr. Aliz Toth
