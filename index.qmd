### Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This repository is a collection of resources on Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and implementation in R.

Lectures on DiD (from my lectures on causal inference):

1.  [Exogeneity](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/frameworks1.pdf) (Background for DiD and causal inference)
2.  [Potential Outcomes](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/frameworks2.pdf) (Background for DiD and causal inference)
3.  [Classical DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did1.pdf)
4.  [Generalised DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did2.pdf)
5.  [Staggered DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did3.pdf)
6.  [Extensions to DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did4.pdf)

### Acknowledgements

This repository was created to help me collect all that I had learned about DiD together into one place. I hope this can be helpful for others.

I would like to thank the following individuals for teaching me so much about DiD and causal inference during my Master's degree at LSE:

-   Dr. Daniel de Kadt
-   Dr. Aliz Toth
