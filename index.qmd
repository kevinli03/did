### Introduction

Difference-in-differences (DiD) is one of the most widely used methods for estimating causal effects. It is often the go-to design for Policy analysts, Economists, and Epidemiologists.

This repository is a collection of resources on the causal identification strategy of Difference-in-Differences (DiD). This repository includes:

1.  A basic overview of DiD, including how it works, and the assumptions.
2.  Overview of the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator.
3.  Exploration of the issues with TWFE in staggered and non-absorbing settings.
4.  Modern DiD estimators to deal with issues with TWFE.
5.  Other additional useful resources.

This repository was created to help me collect all that I had learned about DiD together into one place. I hope this can be helpful for others.

I would like to thank the following individuals for teaching me so much about DiD and causal inference:

-   Dr. Aliz Toth
-   Dr. Daniel de Kadt
