If the pre-treatment effects are significantly different than 0, that is evidence against parallel trends.\nWe can address this using conditional parallel trends - parallel trends met when conditioning on covariates with differing trends.\n\n\nNo Anticipation\nThe treated group’s outcome variables do not respond to treatment before treatment officially begins.\nTesting is done theoretically.\nWe address this by altering the treatment variable (move forward/backward) to match the anticipation structure.\n\n\nStable Unit Treatment Value (SUTVA)\nOne unit’s treatment status does not affect the potential outcomes of another unit.\nTesting is done theoretically.\nVery little can be done to address this.\n\n\nStable Group Composition\n(Repeated cross-section only). The sample from each time period is consistent in terms of composition of confounders.\nTesting can be done with balance tests.\nWe can address this issue by controlling for confounders that differ between different samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\nResource\nAuthor\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nYiqing Xu: modern advancements in DiD\nYiqing Xu\nUseful overview of all modern DiD methods and R code.\n\n\nAsjad Naqvi: repository on DiD\nAsjad Naqvi\nUseful R and state code for DiD.\n\n\nUser Guides for DiD\nBrantly Callaway\nUseful guides and explanations of DiD with R.\n\n\nLecture: Problems with TWFE\nPedro Sant’Anna\nBacon decomposition and introduction to csdid.\n\n\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape\nScott Cunningham\nTextbook chapter introducing DiD.\n\n\nChiu et al (2025)\nChiu et al\nPaper exploring new DiD methods and reanalysing old polisci papers.\n\n\nRoth et al (2025)\nRoth et al\nAn overview of new DiD methods.\n\n\nLiu et al (2025)\nLiu et al\nAn overview of imputation DiD methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis repository was created to help me collect all that I had learned about DiD together into one place.

For example, if treatment is assigned by county/state, use that as the id variable.\n\n\n\ntime\nA variable indicating time-periods in our study for each observation.\n\n\noutcome\nOutcome variable for each observation.\n\n\ntreat\nTreatment variable for each observation. Should equal 1 for treated units and 0 for untreated units.\n\n\nrel.time\nA relative time variable that indicates for the given period \\(t\\) of an observation, how many time-periods away did the unit \\(i\\) first get the treatment. For example, if unit \\(i\\) is treated in 2005, and the observation \\(it\\) is from 2003, the relative time would be -2.** This means rel.time = 0 at the initial year of treatment for unit \\(i\\).\n\n** A common question is regarding never-treated units. Generally, we do not set rel.time to NA for observations that never get treated. This can cause issues with estimation. We generally either 1) set it to a large or small number not in the range of the time variable, or 2) set it to 0 (as in csdid).\n\n\n\ngroup\nVariable specifying if a unit is part of the treatment group or never-treated (control group). For units never receiving treatment, they get value 0, and for units that do end up receiving treatment sometime within the study, they get value 1.\n\nThis is different from treat. For never-treated units, treat = group always. But for units who at sometime receive treatment, group = 1 for all time periods (including periods before receiving treatment). treat = 1 is only after receiving treatment, treat = 0 is before receiving treatment.\n\n\n\ncovar\n(optional) covariate(s) to condition for parallel trends.",

Since we do not want the coefficients to be different than 0, we want to get a high p-value and fail to reject the null.\nAn Equivalence (TOST) test tests if the confidence intervals of our pre-treatment coefficients are within 0.36 standard deviations of the outcome variable of 0. Essentially, it tests if there is a substantively significant deviation in parallel trends.",

The simplest way is to use the default plot - in the original model estimation within did_multiplegt_dyn(), set graph_off = equal to F.\nHowever, the default plot is kind of ugly (in my opinion), and also does not use the conventional numbering of the initial treatment period (it uses t=1 as the initial treatment period). Thus, we can also manually create a ggplot:\n\n# extract effects (the rev() function used because placebo effects are in the opposite order)\neffects = c(rev(mod$results$Placebos[,1]), 0, mod$results$Effects[,1])  # extract pre/post effects\nlwr = c(rev(mod$results$Placebos[,3]), 0, mod$results$Effects[,3])  # extract lower confint\nupr = c(rev(mod$results$Placebos[,4]), 0, mod$results$Effects[,4]) # extract upper confint\n\n# create rel.time variable matching number of pre/post periods\nrel.time = c(-5:3)\n\n# create plotting dataframe\nplot.df = data.frame(rel.time, effects, lwr, upr)\n\n# ggplot\nplot.df |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rel.time, y = effects)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.5, color = \"gray\") +\n  labs(title = \"Event-Study Estimates (DIDmultipleDYN)\") +\n  xlab(\"Time to initial treatment period\") +\n  ylab(\"Estimate\") +\n  theme_light()",
